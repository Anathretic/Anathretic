# Hi, I'm Konrad Wojtyło! 👋

*I'm a passionate Front-End Developer who is trying to master React/Next.js and also loves learning new technologies. I started my programming adventure while still in high school, learning the C and C++ languages, which I used to create simple modifications for many games. One day I will become a game developer - it's a little dream ❤️. However, I do not exclude working on future projects as a frontend or fullstack developer.*

## About me 📖

- 💻 **I'm currently working on:** a few React/Next.js projects for my clients - simple web applications as well as more complex ones that also require mobile apps in the App Store or Google Play.
- 💰 **Previously, I worked as a sales and marketing specialist and leader of a small team**, but due to my love of programming, I decided to deep dive into IT.
- 🌱 **I'm constantly learning and improving my skills (hard and soft).** But because of my passion to games, I am learning C++/C# to use it in Unreal Engine and Unity. However, I am also learning Python because I would like to use it to create APIs and work with AI sometimes.
- 👯 **I'm open to any interesting project.** I have experience with many tools and love to share good code practices.
- 💬 **Feel free to ask me about my tech-stack, experience or projects.** I do not bite! 🤭
