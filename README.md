# Hi, I'm Konrad Wojtyło! 👋

*I'm a passionate Front-End Developer who is trying to master React/Next.js and also loves learning new technologies. I started my programming adventure while still in high school, learning the C and C++ languages, which I used to create simple modifications for many games. In the future I want to become a fullstack developer (or a game developer - it's a little dream ❤️), but right now I'm focusing on the Front-End.*

## About me 📖

- 💻 **I'm currently working on:** a project in Next.js that I am working on with a small team.
- 💰 **Previously, I worked as a sales and marketing specialist and leader of a small team**, but due to my love of programming, I decided to deep dive into IT.
- 🌱 **I'm constantly learning and improving my skills (hard and soft).** But due to the demand in the team, I am slowly mastering Node.js and recalling Java.
- 👯 **I'm open to collaborating on Front-End web development projects.** I have an experience with clients and tools like Supabase, Firebase or Strapi.
- 💬 **Feel free to ask me about Front-End technologies and JavaScript.** If you want of course!
