# Hi, I'm Konrad Wojtyło! 👋
Tech Lead & Software Engineer

*I’m a Software Engineer with several years of commercial experience, currently leading the technical direction of a large-scale platform. I specialize in designing scalable architectures, aligning frontend and backend teams, and delivering products that balance long-term maintainability with real business impact.*

*I started my programming journey in high school with C and C++, building simple game modifications. Today, I combine that early low-level foundation with modern web technologies to guide teams and systems from concept to production.*

## 🚀 What I do

- Lead technical architecture and decision-making across frontend, backend, and system integration
- Translate product and business goals into robust, scalable technical solutions
- Mentor developers, conduct code reviews, and establish engineering best practices
- Collaborate closely with product, UX/UI, and QA to ensure high-quality delivery
- Drive MVP and milestone deliveries while keeping technical debt under control

## 🛠 Current tech-stack

- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Redux, React Query, Jotai, Zod, Storybook, Cypress, Vitest
- **Backend:** C# (.NET), Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, NoSQL, Firebase, Supabase
- **Game-Dev:** Unity (C#), Unreal Engine (C++)

## 📈 Background

Before transitioning fully into software engineering in 2021, I worked in sales and marketing, leading a small team. This background helps me bridge technical decisions with business needs and communicate effectively across disciplines.

## 🤝 Collaboration

I’m open to meaningful projects where engineering quality, ownership, and impact matter. I enjoy sharing best practices and building systems that scale with both teams and products.
