# Hi, I'm Konrad Wojtyło! 👋

*I'm a passionate Front-End Developer who is trying to master React/Next.js and also loves learning new technologies. I started my programming adventure while still in high school, learning the C and C++ languages, which I used to create simple modifications for many games. One day I will become a game developer - it's a little dream ❤️. However, I do not exclude working on projects as a **frontend** or **fullstack** developer.*

## About me 📖

- 💻 **I'm currently working on** an huge app for the Bolt partner and several smaller orders. The projects require me to use **frontend** as well as **backend** technologies.
- 💰 **Previously, I worked as a sales and marketing specialist and leader of a small team**, but due to my love of programming, I decided to deep dive into IT.
- 🌱 **I'm constantly learning and improving my skills (hard and soft).** But because of my passion to games, I am learning C++/C# to use it in Unreal Engine and Unity. However, I am also expanding my knowledge of Python, as I would like to use it to create APIs and sometimes work with AI.
- 👯 **I'm open to any interesting project.** I have experience with many tools and love to share good code practices.
- 💬 **Feel free to ask me about my tech-stack, experience or projects.** I do not bite! 🤭

## Current tech-stack* 💻

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript, React, React Native, React Redux, TypeScript, Next.js
- **Backend:** Python, Django, Node.js, Express.js *- but I need some time to understand more advanced issues.*
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, NoSQL (Firebase, Supabase)

* *but these are only the most important tools!* 😉
