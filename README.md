# Hi, I'm Konrad Wojtyło! 👋

*I am a passionate Front-End Developer who is trying to master React and also loves learning new technologies. I started my programming adventure while still in high school, learning the C and C++ languages, which I used to create simple modifications for many games. In the future I want to become a fullstack developer, but right now I am focusing on the frontend.*

## About me 📖

- 💻 **I'm currently working on:** starting the Next.js project - an app to display comics (incl. register/login).
- 💰 **Previously, I worked as a sales and marketing specialist and leader of a small team**, but due to my love of programming, I decided to deep dive into IT.
- 🌱 **I'm constantly learning and improving my coding skills.** But because of my studies I am slowly returning to C++, and thinking about C#.
- 👯 **I'm open to collaborating on Front-End web development projects.** I have an experience with clients and tools like Supabase, Firebase or Strapi.
- 💬 **Feel free to ask me about Front-End technologies and JavaScript.** If you want of course!
